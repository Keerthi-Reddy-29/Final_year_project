0,"5.0 out of 5 starsFive stars for the ""one-star reviews"" book.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 21, 2016","OK, this book is hilarious!  I got one for a friend who was recuperating from a surgery.  He laughed so hard, his respiratory therapist commented that every patient should have this book to assist in the breathing exercises of recuperation.I then got the book for myself, and found it to be a laugh out loud experience.  We have all had occasion or desire to give a one star review, and here its this book you can see that you are not alone.Read more"
1,1.0 out of 5 starsVery Poorly Done - Do Not Buy,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 24, 2015","One of the POOREST books of its kind - my advice to everyone - don't buy this. Each page has one review - usually a Single sentence ... below it a large picture of the product taking lots of space ... and then a few sentences by the author  - not funny or witty, though she thinks she is.This book would be overpriced at 99 cents. I've read much better of this type of book - and found much funnier and crazier reviews on Amazon!!As for the buyers who gave this book 5 STARS - my thinking is they must all be friends of the author. If I could return this book I would. Because I can't - I am just throwing it in the trash. Again - Don't Waste Your Money On This Book. It's bland beyond belief - and Not Funny At All.Read more"
2,"4.0 out of 5 stars""Butterfly Conservatory Did Not Feature A Single Waterslide....""",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 11, 2015","C. Coville, author of ""One-Star Reviews"", has trolled the Internet for idiotic reviews so you don't have to. Some of these reviews are so otherworldly that they defy classification. The complaints range from almost sane to completely unreal. For example, a highly tasteless novelty pen holder was criticized thus: ""My wife bought this for me as a gag gift. I hate it for so many reasons. It came from china [sic] in styro-foam [sic] wrapped in tape. (worried about cancer)"" So your wife buys you a pen holder in which the pen comes out of a plastic butt and cancer is your biggest concern? Ponder. An even more extreme review was for an Atkins diet book. Now I'm no expert on dieting, but I do have some questions after reading this review: ""My wife lost the use of her legs and out cat is dead....What kind of madness is this diet? It's bad karma from killing animals."" I couldn't possibly make that up.If you want to see a truly entitled complainer, examine the review of Vroman's Bookstore, which reads in part ""I dont [sic] like Vromans [sic] and I have a valid reason. I only go to bookstores to read their tabloid magazines for free! I usually buy my books online since its way cheaper."" The reviewer goes on to complain that they have their magazines outside but don't have tables outside for you to relax for hours while reading but not buying their merchandise. Imagine the nerve! I was especially fond of the hotel reviews inasmuch as I stay in a lot of hotels. Perhaps my favorite was a review of Las Vegas' Artisan Hotel Boutique, ""Very dark hallways with red lighting and disturbing paintings literally covering every inch of the walls and ceiling....We had to cover up one of the paintings in our room just so I could sleep."" In the best but most obscure bit of commentary in the book, Coville opines ""At 3 a.m. I woke up to find that the covering had fallen off and the eyes of the person in the painting were pointed in my direction. The voice of the demon Pazuzu asked me if I needed any more towels."" (If you don't get the Pazuzu reference, it relates to a Babylonian god, and one of the worst movies ever made, ""Exorcist II: The Heretic."")Some of the reviews are entirely more sensible, like this one for a very expensive book called ""The 2009-2014 World Outlook for 60-Milligram Containers of Fromage Frais"", which brilliantly expounds ""A 60 milligram container would be 1/16 of a gram, or about 1/450 of an ounce. I can tell you exactly what the market outlook for 60mg containers of fromage frais - none. There is no market outlook for 60mg containers of fromage frais, for the simple reason that they do not exist."" Finally, the book closes with a critique of the US Army: ""It's a fact that vaccines contain some of the most harmful crap known to man. And you will have A LOT of vaccines during your time in the US military."" It's definitely true that the people in the military are in harm's way. Due to vaccines. That's their biggest worry…vaccines…a point Coville  was fast to make, although I'm sure that even if you could opt out of vaccines the author probably wouldn't be volunteering to serve anytime soon for a host of other reasons.This is a very quick and occasionally uneven book, but to show the gross excesses of the Internet, it's a funny and scary gem.Read more"
3,"5.0 out of 5 starsThese exist, and that both terrifies and amuses me",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2014","C. Coville has been kind enough to plumb the depths of the Internet to find these things, and that makes me suspect this author has lost more than a few sanity points in the process. Thank you for your sacrifice.The critical thing to understand about this book is that it compiles two kinds of reviews: justified, and unjustified. Either way, they are 1 star reviews. (It could be argued that a few fall in the category of ""just plain crazy"", but that's something that could take up an entire academic paper, so I will avoid expanding on that for now.)What's so funny about justified 1 star reviews?There are places and things that are so, so awful, yet are still available for sale/rent/hire, and their customers survived long enough to post reviews. Some of the reviews are hilarious in their stark detail, others are hilarious in the level of wit used to describe their stark detail. Either way: hilarious! (Until I find myself one of those customers, in which case, HELP ME!)What's so funny about unjustified 1 star reviews?Some people have... interesting... views on how the world operates. Sometimes these people are able to use the Internet in some fashion. In the process, some are able to leave reviews of products that have somehow failed them. Failed them in ways that most rational primates would never have expected those products to serve. Someday, I expect that when alien conquerors put humanity on trial, some of these reviews will be part of the evidence against us. Our defense will be things like this book, ""Look, here are publications where we mocked them! WE MOCKED THEM!""Read more"
4,"5.0 out of 5 starsIt came in sturdy, corrugated cardboard",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 17, 2014","I actually ordered this because I got yet another cat and needed a new box because none of my other cats wanted to share.  It came in sturdy, corrugated cardboard, and was just the perfect size.  Lord Bigsby Fluffytumkins settled right in and soon was accepted by the other cats.  I like to think having a nice box to sit in helped with this transition.  So thanks, C. Coville, for helping me get such a nice box for my precious kitty.  The book was a nice bonus, I enjoyed it almost as much as Ari Dafini enjoys her perch on top of it.Read more"
5,2.0 out of 5 starsNot that funny.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2015",Went through three quarters of the book without laughing.  Only towards the last chunk (about bad restaurants) did I chuckle a bit.  Guess this type of humor just ain't my thing.Read more
6,3.0 out of 5 starsI expected a too-long list,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 10, 2014","And I got it. I laughed a couple of times. But this book could have just been a few cracked.com articles. I like Coville's articles, which is mostly why I gave this book a shot. If it was funnier, I'd give it 4 stars, if it wasn't in book form, it would be more honest.Read more"
